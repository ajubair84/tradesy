If I had more time:

  	 - I would perform some negative testing
	- Test Recently viewed section
	- Add 15 - 20 items to see if the cart page behaves differently
	- Remove items from product detail page (PDP) after adding to the cart and verify its also removed from shopping cart
	- Check out functionality
	- Price for multiple items adding correctly and removing updates the price
	- Footer items
